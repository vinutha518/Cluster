               During read operation with DQS clock input (RAM/OPI/DOPI mode), 
               DQS clock will transition from high-impedance to zero after command/address 
               phase is finished. 
               To prevent using such invalid DQS clock, user can adjust these configuration 
               to guarantee data correctness.
               The range is 0 to 15. Actual enable DQS clock input is set value + 1 clock.
               If EnableCnt=0 is set, Enable DQS clock input at 1st SCLK.
               If EnableCnt=1 is set, Enable DQS clock input at 2nd SCLK.
               If EnableCnt=2 is set, Enable DQS clock input at 3rd SCLK.
