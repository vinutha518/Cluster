  Title: HYPB Driver support functions

  HYPB (HyperBus Controller) driver support functions

  The generic HYPB driver uses these functions. They have to be implemented 
  within the driver library for a concrete device. (e.g. D1L, D1M)

  Support functions are functions that are not part of the driver itself 
  but they must be provided to integrate the driver on a particular board.

  Description:
  This function makes the value to set configuration register.
  This function is called from <R_HYPB_Open>.

  This function executes the following processing.
  * Checks the original configuration register value. 
  >  - If it looks normal value, uses the value as-is.

  * Reflects latency code to register value.
  * Reflects parameter-sector settings to register value in case of Hyper Flash.
  * Returns the making register value.

  Customizing Points:
  This function is sample code for (I)S26KL512S/(I)S26KL256S/(I)S26KL128S and IS66WVH16M8BLL.

  This function returns the result code from status register value.
  This function also judges the time out of status polling.
  This function is called from <R_HYPB_DataErase> and <R_HYPB_DataWrite>.

  This function executes the following processing.
  * Checks the calling counter. If it reaches to time-out count, returns R_HYPB_ERR_TIMEOUT. 
  * Checks READY bit. If it shows BUSY state, returns R_HYPB_ERR_NOT_ACCEPTABLE. 
  * Checks Erase / Program Status bit. it shows Successful, returns R_HYPB_ERR_OK. 
  * Checks Sector Lock Status bit. 
  >   - it shows Sector Locked Error, returns R_HYPB_ERR_PROTECTED. 
  >   - it shows Sector Not Locked, returns R_HYPB_ERR_ABORTED. 
  
  Customizing Points:
  * This function is sample code for (I)S26KL512S/(I)S26KL256S/(I)S26KL128S and IS66WVH16M8BLL.
    If you use other Hyper flash or Hyper RAM, it must be changed according to the connected device
    specification.
  * If you want to change time-out count, please modify the definition R_HYPB_STATUS_TIMEOUT in 
    r_config_hypb.h.
  * This function is called from busy wait. Please implement CPU relaxing to avoid blocking.
