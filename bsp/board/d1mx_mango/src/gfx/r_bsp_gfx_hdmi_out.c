        Use configuration by hardware setup (by fixed pin levels of TFP410PAP).

    Set PDZ = high and ISEL/RSTZ = low
        This means, that chip configuration is specified
        by the configuration pins
        (BSEL = high, DSEL = X, EDGE = low, VREF = high(DVDD))
        and state pins (PDZ = high, DKEN = low).
        -> Config above means 24bit single-ended parallel video w/ falling clock edge.

        Note: I2C configuration is not performed. It is only required in case
                DE sync signal shall be generated by the TFP410PAP itself
                based on provided H-/V-Sync signals. But that's not the case.
                

        On D1M2 Mango Board there are 2 units of HDMI output converters.
            1) U32 used for Video Output 0
            2) U24 used for Video Output 1
                Pin states as shown above for this 2 HDMI output converters
                are given by default Pull-Up / -Downs with exception of
                a) BSEL/SCL signal and b) DSEL/SDA signal.
                As signal b) DSEL is don't care (X),
                the init sequence just need to ensure to set signal a) BSEL = high.
